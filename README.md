# Open-Source Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project aims to develop a custom Web Application Firewall (WAF) using **ModSecurity** to detect and block common web attacks.  
Our goal is to enhance the security of web applications by implementing and customizing the **OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS)** to mitigate threats like **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **Broken Authentication**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… **ModSecurity Setup** â€“ Installed and configured as a WAF  
- âœ… **OWASP CRS Integration** â€“ Implemented default rules for security  
- âœ… **Ubuntu VM Deployment** â€“ Running the WAF on a virtualized Linux environment  
- âœ… **GitHub Version Control** â€“ Tracking project updates and changes  
- âœ… **Firewall Configurations** â€“ Basic setup using `iptables` / `firewalld`  
- âœ… **Future Enhancements** â€“ Custom rule modifications and extended security testing

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **ModSecurity** â€“ Open-source WAF for HTTP request filtering  
- **OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS)** â€“ Predefined security rules for common threats  
- **Ubuntu (Linux OS)** â€“ Deployment environment for the WAF  
- **Apache/Nginx** â€“ Web servers to integrate with ModSecurity  
- **iptables / firewalld** â€“ Basic firewall configuration  
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ Version control and collaboration

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### ðŸ”¹ Requirements

Before starting the installation, ensure you have the following:

- **ModSecurity** installed (we used an Apache Web Server)  
- **Ubuntu** environment  
- **Sudo** privileges  
- **OWASP Core Rule Set**  
  If the rule set is already installed, the process becomes easier.  
  However, full installation instructions are available in our repository under `docs/INSTALL.md`, or you can refer to the official [OWASP CRS documentation](https://coreruleset.org/installation/) for the extended setup guide.

### ðŸ§± Installation Process

To use our custom version of the ModSecurity WAF:

1. Download the following files from our GitHub repository:
   - `custom-rules.conf`  
   - `common-passwords.txt`

2. Place them into the appropriate directories:
   - `custom-rules.conf` â†’ inside the **rules** folder of the OWASP CRS setup  
   - `common-passwords.txt` â†’ in the **parent directory** of the rules folder  

3. Assign the correct ownership and permissions:

```bash
sudo chown www-data:www-data custom-rules.conf
sudo chown www-data:www-data common-passwords.txt
sudo chmod 644 custom-rules.conf
sudo chmod 644 common-passwords.txt
