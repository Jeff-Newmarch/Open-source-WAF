# Open-Source Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project aims to develop a custom Web Application Firewall (WAF) using **ModSecurity** to detect and block common web attacks.  
Our goal is to enhance the security of web applications by implementing and customizing the **OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS)** to mitigate threats like **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **Broken Authentication**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… **ModSecurity Setup** â€“ Installed and configured as a WAF  
- âœ… **OWASP CRS Integration** â€“ Implemented default rules for security  
- âœ… **Ubuntu VM Deployment** â€“ Running the WAF on a virtualized Linux environment  
- âœ… **GitHub Version Control** â€“ Tracking project updates and changes  
- âœ… **Firewall Configurations** â€“ Basic setup using `iptables` / `firewalld`  
- âœ… **Future Enhancements** â€“ Custom rule modifications and extended security testing

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **ModSecurity** â€“ Open-source WAF for HTTP request filtering  
- **OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS)** â€“ Predefined security rules for common threats  
- **Ubuntu (Linux OS)** â€“ Deployment environment for the WAF  
- **Apache/Nginx** â€“ Web servers to integrate with ModSecurity  
- **iptables / firewalld** â€“ Basic firewall configuration  
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ Version control and collaboration

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### ðŸ”¹ Requirements

Before starting the installation, ensure you have the following:

- **ModSecurity** installed (we used an Apache Web Server)  
- **Ubuntu** environment  
- **Sudo** privileges  
- **OWASP Core Rule Set**  
  If the rule set is already installed, the process becomes easier.
