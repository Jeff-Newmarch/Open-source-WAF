Open-Source Web Application Firewall (WAF)
🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a custom Web Application Firewall (WAF) using ModSecurity to detect and block common web attacks. Our goal is to enhance the security of web applications by implementing and customizing the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) to mitigate threats like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Broken Authentication.

📌 Features
✔️ ModSecurity Setup – Installed and configured as a WAF
✔️ OWASP CRS Integration – Implementing default rules for security
✔️ Ubuntu VM Deployment – Running the WAF on a virtualized Linux environment
✔️ GitHub Version Control – Tracking project updates and changes
✔️ Firewall Configurations – Basic setup using iptables/firewalld
✔️ Future Enhancements – Custom rule modifications and security testing

🛠 Technologies Used
ModSecurity – Open-source WAF for HTTP request filtering
OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) – Predefined security rules for common threats
Ubuntu (Linux OS) – Deployment environment for the WAF
Apache/Nginx – Web servers to integrate with ModSecurity
iptables/firewalld – Basic firewall configuration
Git & GitHub – Version control and collaboration
